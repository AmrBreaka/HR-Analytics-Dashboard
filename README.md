# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Excited to share my latest Tableau project: An HR Analytics Dashboard! <br>
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee demographics, attrition rates, and job satisfaction across various departments and age groups. It allows HR professionals to identify trends and areas for improvement in talent retention strategies. <br>
key features include:<br>
â€¢	Employee demographics: See the total number of employees, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, average age, and attrition by gender.<br>
â€¢	Departmental analysis: Drill down into attrition rates and employee distribution by department.<br>
â€¢	Age group analysis: Analyze the number of employees by age group bin size and attrition rate.<br>
â€¢	Job satisfaction rating: Gauge employee sentiment across departments.<br>
â€¢	Education field-wise attrition: See attrition rates by education field.<br>
â€¢	Attrition rate by gender for different age groups: Analyze attrition trends across genders and age groups.<br>
